Technical Test - Yield Prediction

Using the information provided in this zip file, your task is to train a
basic machine learning model in Python to predict annual soybean yields in the US on a state level
for all states included in the yield CSV file.

You are free to use whatever Python libraries you consider relevant.
Please do not spend more than three hours on this exercise. The focus should be on the
process and documentation of training machine learning models rather than the final
predictive performance.

Please include all Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks, including data exploration and preparation, required to reproduce your results.
